# Dev

Working records used to understand and evolve this repository. They are not user or
API documentation. The architecture overview belongs in the root `README.md`;
package documentation belongs in each Go package's `doc.go`.

Each folder has a `README.md` describing its contents and expected format.

| Folder               | Purpose                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| principles/README.md | Design principles and guidelines for the repository.                                       |
| studies/README.md    | Evidence-backed examinations of the repository, system behavior, architecture, or tooling. |
| bugs/README.md       | Confirmed defects awaiting correction.                                                     |
| backlog/README.md    | Implementation and tuning work not currently planned.                                      |
| plans/README.md      | Active implementation plans divided into executable steps.                                 |

## Flow

Principles guide development. Studies help gather evidence, answer questions, and
inform decisions. Their outcomes may lead to bugs, backlog items, plans, or no further
action.

These records are working tools, not a required process. Create, link, update, or
remove them as useful. Git history preserves completed work.

Short-lived or external actions, such as live verification, belong in the root `.todo`.
